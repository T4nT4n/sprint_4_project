Student Comments:
- So I need to format the entire dataframe? I think I only formatted the columns that I used for analysis.
- For the odometer column, it's difficult to tell what values to replace for the null values. I can't use zero because zero is already present in the column. Moreover, whenever I filter the dataframe with cars that have 0 for the odometer column, it appears to be random. Thus, I cannot establish a pattern that indicates what I could substitute for the null values in the odometer. I may add a -1 to indicate that it was missing.
